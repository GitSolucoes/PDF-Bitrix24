# pdf-bitrix-integration
This repository contains a Flask-based API for integration with Bitrix24, enabling the automatic filling of PDFs with data extracted from CRM deals. The API processes PDF documents by populating fields with relevant information such as name, CPF, address, and status, and subsequently uploads the filled PDF back to Bitrix24.
